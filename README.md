Idea - We have created a pizza ordering application for customers. Our application is named "Pizza Mania". 

Description of the application

Purpose: The purpose was to create an application for a small business and with the help of this online application, reduce waiting time for customers at the outlet. Customers can place their orders from home and then collect it from the outlet.

Functionality: Users come to the website and can select their pizzas, crust and toppings and place their order.

Instructions for use:
It initalizes options as per customer's input. We have tried an MVP version with two pizzas, toppings and crust. We can later scale it up to have more than one pizza in one order.
